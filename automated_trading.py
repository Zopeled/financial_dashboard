# This while loop is reponsible for storing the historical data for each ticker in our list. Note that yahoo finance sometimes incurs json.decode errors and because of this we are sleeping for 2 seconds after each iteration, also if a call fails we are going to try to execute it again. Also, do not make more than 2,000 calls per hour or 48,000 calls per day or Yahoo Finance may block your IP.
